Let $S =\{U\}$ be a system of open intervals $U$ that cover the closed interval $[a,b] = I_{1}$. If the interval $I_{1}$ couldn't be covered by a finite set of intervals of the system $S$, then, dividing $I_{1}$ into two halves, one would find that at least one of the two halves, which is denoted by $I_{2}$, doesn't admit a finite covering. This procedure shall now be repeated with the interval $I_{2}$ and so on. 

In this way a nested sequence $I_{1} \supset I_{2} \supset \dots \supset I_{n} \supset \dots$ of closed intervals arises, none of which admit a covering by a finite subsystem of $S$. Since the length of the interval $I_{n}$ is $| I_{n} |$ is $|I_n| = |I_{1}| \cdot 2^{-n}$, the sequence $\{I_{n} \}$ contains intervals of arbitrarily small length (see [[Chapter 2 - The Most Important Classes of Real Numbers and Computational Aspects of Operations with Real Numbers|computational aspects of real numbers]]). But the nested interval theorem implies that there's a point $c$ belonging to all of the intervals $I_{n}, n \in \mathbb{N}$. Since $c \in I_{1} = [a,b]$, there's an open interval $]\alpha,\beta[ = U \subset S$ containing $c$, such that $\alpha < c < \beta$. Let $\varepsilon = \text{min}(\{ c- \alpha, \beta - c \})$. In the sequence just constructed, an interval $I_{n}$ can be found such that $|I_{n}| < \varepsilon$. Since $c \in I_{n}$ and $|I_{n}| < \varepsilon$, it can be concluded that $I_{n} \subset U = ]\alpha,\beta[$. However, this contradicts the fact that $I_{n}$ can't be covered by a finite set of intervals from the system.
